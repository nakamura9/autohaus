      "question": "Can I negotiate the price of a vehicle?",

      "question": "What is the difference between a dealer and a private seller?",
      "answer": "Dealers are verified businesses that sell multiple vehicles and often provide warranties, financing options, and after-sales services. Private sellers are individuals selling their personal vehicles, typically at lower prices but without the additional services dealers offer. Listings are clearly tagged to show whether they're from dealers or private sellers."

      "answer": "To list your vehicle, navigate to the 'Sell' page and fill out the listing form with details about your vehicle including make, model, year, mileage, price, condition, and upload clear photos. Once submitted, your listing will be reviewed and published on the platform. Make sure to provide accurate information and quality photos to attract potential buyers."

      "question": "How are payments processed?",
      "answer": "Autohaus is a marketplace platform that connects buyers and sellers. We do not process payments directly. Payment arrangements are made between the buyer and seller. We recommend meeting in person, inspecting the vehicle thoroughly, and using secure payment methods such as bank transfers or cashier's checks. Never send money before seeing the vehicle in person."

      "question": "How do I know if a seller is trustworthy?",
      "answer": "Look for verified dealer badges on listings, which indicate the seller has been verified by Autohaus. Read any available reviews or ratings. Always arrange to meet the seller in a public place, bring someone with you, and thoroughly inspect the vehicle. Check the vehicle's history report and verify all documentation. If something feels off, trust your instincts and walk away."

      "question": "What should I check before buying a used vehicle?",
      "answer": "Before purchasing, verify the vehicle's chassis number matches the documentation, check the service history, inspect for any damage or signs of poor maintenance, take it for a test drive, and consider getting a professional pre-purchase inspection. Verify the seller's identity and ownership documents. Check if the vehicle has any outstanding finance or has been reported stolen. Request a vehicle history report to check for accidents or major repairs."
